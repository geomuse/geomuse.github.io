<p>要想有所专长，就要追求真正的兴趣和热爱，而不是盲目追逐热点。
累积专长的过程，对你而言就像玩耍，对他人来说则很吃力。</p>

<p>要想获得财富，就必须充分利用杠杆效应。商业杠杆来自资本、劳动力和复制边际成本为零的产品（代码和媒体）。</p>

<p>投资加密货币 币安eth,btc.etc 但是价值会被提升吗?</p>

<p>那就出书、写博客、做视频、录播客</p>

<p>你应该忙得没时间社交，但依然把日程安排得井然有序</p>

<p>在自己选择的职业领域里做到全球顶尖。不断重新定义自己的事业，直到理想成为现实。</p>

<p>我能提供什么独特的价值？ “产品化”</p>

<p>如果为了自己产品化 必须做到有价值.  英文和代码 博客</p>

<p>生活中所有的回报都来自复利</p>

<p>我不是说那99%的事情都不要做，因为我们很难确定剩下的1%到底是什么。我的意思是：努力找到不会被浪费的1%。这1%对你是有意义的，值得你用余生去追求。一旦找到，你就要心无旁骛，全力以赴</p>

<p>你对退休的定义是什么？
退休就是不再为了想象中的明天而牺牲今天。当你能活在当下，内心充盈地度过每一天时，你就达到了退休的状态。
如何达到退休状态？
第一种方法是存钱。只要存款够多，被动收入（不用动一根手指）就能满足开销。
第二种方法是把开销降为零——出家修行。
第三种方法是做自己热爱的事情，完全乐在其中，有钱没钱无所谓。所以，实现退休状态有很多种方法。</p>

<p>sustainable 不可持续</p>

<p>Most US Parents Worried About Future of Planet</p>

<p>Most US parents are worried about what the world will look like when their children grow up, according to a new survey.</p>

<p>A survey done by Talker Research found that 72% of parents think the future doesn’t look very bright.</p>

<p>About a quarter said they’re worried about climate change, while others are concerned about the jobs market and politics in the future.</p>

<p>However, many parents are trying to make the world better for their children by encouraging good habits that are better for the planet.</p>

<p>These habits include things like giving old clothes and toys to other people to use again, turning off lights after leaving a room, and using less water in the bathroom or kitchen.</p>

<p>Most parents think it’s important for their generation to make a difference before it’s too late.</p>

<p>But some said that although they’d like to make sustainable choices, especially when they’re shopping, they often put cost and convenience first.</p>

<p>That may mean buying things that are not as good for the planet and can only be used once, like paper towels.</p>

<p>Two thousand parents with children under the age of 18 took part in the survey.</p>

<p>In the last few years, some people have decided not to have children because of their worries about climate change and the future of the planet.</p>

<p>Some worry about the future, while others believe that bringing more people into the world will only make climate change worse.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="language" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[bright 光亮]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">One of the World’s Smallest Countries Gets First ATMs</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/language/english005/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One of the World’s Smallest Countries Gets First ATMs" /><published>2025-04-24T11:24:29+08:00</published><updated>2025-04-24T11:24:29+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/language/english005</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/language/english005/"><![CDATA[<p>ceremony 议式</p>

<p>One of the World’s Smallest Countries Gets First ATMs</p>

<p>April 15 was an exciting day for one of the world’s smallest countries, as Tuvalu got its first ATMs.</p>

<p>Tuvalu is made up of a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, and only about 11,000 people live there. The total land area of the islands is just 26 square kilometers.</p>

<p>There are now five ATMs on the main island of Funafuti, where about half of the country’s residents live.</p>

<p>A ceremony with Prime Minister Feleti Teo and other government staff was held at the National Bank of Tuvalu in the village of Vaiaku. Bank CEO Siose Penitala Teo was pictured trying out the ATM for the first time.</p>

<p>“These were dreams for us,” Teo said, speaking with The Guardian.</p>

<p>It took nearly $2 million and about four years for those dreams to become a reality.</p>

<p>According to The Guardian, until now, people would have to go to the bank on pay day to receive their money. This could take hours, and was not made easier by the fact that the bank closes at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>There are now also 30 sales terminals on the island, meaning shops will be able to take electronic payments for the first time. Until now, almost everything on Tuvalu was paid for by cash.</p>

<p>However, only prepaid cards can be used on the machines for now. The bank plans to introduce debit cards in the future.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="language" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[ceremony 议式]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">30% of S.

<p>crisis 危机</p>

<p>Last year in South Korea, thousands of people completed PhDs. But according to new government data, almost three in 10 of them don’t have a job.</p>

<p>Statistics Korea spoke to more than 10,000 people who finished their PhD studies in 2024. It found that 30% weren’t working at the time of the survey, which was done between August 2024 and February 2025.</p>

<p>This is the highest number since Statistics Korea began collecting this data in 2014.</p>

<p>Younger people with PhDs found it even harder to find work, according to the survey. Of the 537 PhD graduates aged under 30 who took part in the survey, almost half were unemployed.</p>

<p>That’s also higher than ever before.</p>

<p>However, some graduates found it harder to find work than others. Those who completed PhDs in arts and humanities were most likely to be unemployed.</p>

<p>Just over 40% of these graduates said they hadn’t found work, while 38% of math graduates hadn’t gotten jobs either.</p>

<p>Those who did PhDs in subjects like health, education and business found it easier to get work.</p>

<p>Some people have said that because of economic uncertainty in the country, South Korean companies prefer experienced workers.</p>

<p>And it’s not just PhD graduates who are finding things difficult — 40% of people in their 20s in South Korea are not working.</p>

<p>It’s being called an “unemployment crisis” among young people. And cities around the country have been creating programs to try to help these young people get jobs — and to keep them from giving up on looking for work.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="language" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[uncertainty 不确定性]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Get Back on the Bike - How to Become a Better Cyclist</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/language/english003/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Get Back on the Bike - How to Become a Better Cyclist" /><published>2025-04-22T11:24:29+08:00</published><updated>2025-04-22T11:24:29+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/language/english003</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/language/english003/"><![CDATA[<p>Get Back on the Bike: How to Become a Better Cyclist</p>

<p>As the weather gets warmer, many of us will be getting our bicycles out.</p>

<p>But if you haven’t ridden for a while, or if you’re new to cycling, it isn’t always as easy as it might look!</p>

<p>Experts say there are a few things you can do to make yourself a better rider — while making sure you’re still safe and having fun.
Get the right equipment</p>

<p>One of the most important things to do is to make sure you have the right equipment, says Cycling Weekly. That doesn’t mean you need an expensive bike, but you could spend some money on making sure your bike is set up right for you.</p>

<p>Getting some comfortable clothes is also a good idea — especially some shorts that give you support when you’re on the saddle.
Get strong</p>

<p>If you want to improve your speed and go for longer cycles, the Bicycling website suggests working on your core strength.</p>

<p>When you’re riding for a long time, your core will be working hard, and the site says things like doing planks can help, while others recommend Pilates.
Look for friends</p>

<p>The Bike Radar website says riding with others, perhaps as part of a club, can help you stay motivated.</p>

<p>And riding in a group can also make you safer on the roads, as long as you don’t get too close to the bike in front of you!
Practice</p>

<p>Just like any activity, practice is likely to make you better and stronger. If you haven’t got lots of extra time, riding to work is a good way of getting some more practice during the week.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="language" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get Back on the Bike: How to Become a Better Cyclist]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fake Banana Yoshimoto Book Appears on Amazon</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/language/english002/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fake Banana Yoshimoto Book Appears on Amazon" /><published>2025-04-21T11:24:29+08:00</published><updated>2025-04-21T11:24:29+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/language/english002</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/language/english002/"><![CDATA[<p>outrageous 令人愤慨</p>

<p>Fake Banana Yoshimoto Book Appears on Amazon</p>

<p>Banana Yoshimoto, the famous Japanese author of Kitchen and Goodbye Tsugumi, unexpectedly excited fans when a new e-book called Sekai ni wa Jikan ga Nai (The World Is Running Out of Time) appeared on Amazon under her name.</p>

<p>But there was one big problem — she never wrote it.</p>

<p>On February 25, the famous author posted on social media, telling readers not to buy the fake e-book, which was being sold on Amazon Japan.</p>

<p>“I ask my readers to not buy a copy by mistake,” she wrote on X. “This is outrageous.”</p>

<p>Yoshimoto said she first heard about the fake e-book when someone asked if she had published something new. After checking, the author realized the book was not hers.</p>

<p>After she spoke out on X, Amazon took down the e-book the next day. However, it’s still unclear who published it or why.</p>

<p>Amazon’s Kindle platform lets anyone publish e-books or printed books by themselves. This makes it easy for writers to share their work, but it also means fake books can appear.</p>

<p>Yoshimoto told The Asahi Shimbun that Amazon should do more to check for fake books and stop them from being sold.</p>

<p>And this isn’t the first time she’s had problems with the platform. In the past, she found a book review that copied large parts of her writing without permission.</p>

<p>Another time, an e-book was published under a different author’s name, but it was clearly based on her work.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="language" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[outrageous 令人愤慨]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Airport Theory - The Last-Minute Travel Trend</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/language/english001/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Airport Theory - The Last-Minute Travel Trend" /><published>2025-04-20T11:24:29+08:00</published><updated>2025-04-20T11:24:29+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/language/english001</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/language/english001/"><![CDATA[<p>rush  匆忙</p>

<p>Airport Theory: The Last-Minute Travel Trend</p>

<p>Arriving at the airport 15 minutes before your flight might sound crazy, but for some travelers, it’s the new normal.</p>

<p>A new travel trend called “airport theory” is becoming popular online, especially on TikTok. The idea is simple, but risky: arrive at the airport just before your flight boards — sometimes only 15 minutes early — and try to make it through security in time.</p>

<p>People doing this will check in online and bring only carry-on bags. This means they don’t have to go to the check-in desk, and can go straight to security instead.</p>

<p>This trend is growing on TikTok, where users post videos of themselves rushing through the airport. Some users have posted videos where they make it to their gate quickly, even in big, busy airports.</p>

<p>But many others aren’t so lucky, and have shared videos where they’ve missed their flights.</p>

<p>So while it might work for a few lucky travelers, most experts don’t recommend trying “airport theory.”</p>

<p>Security checks take time, and before you even get to the airport, you might get stuck in traffic or have other delays. And after security, it can also take time to find your gate, especially in larger airports.</p>

<p>That’s why most airports still recommend arriving two hours before domestic flights and three hours before international ones.</p>

<p>Airport theory might look exciting online, but it doesn’t work for everyone. For most people, getting to the airport earlier is a safer and more comfortable way to travel.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="language" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[rush 匆忙]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">You Are Feeling Sleepy - The Truth About Hypnotherapy</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/language/english000/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="You Are Feeling Sleepy - The Truth About Hypnotherapy" /><published>2025-04-19T11:24:29+08:00</published><updated>2025-04-19T11:24:29+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/language/english000</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/language/english000/"><![CDATA[<p>You Are Feeling Sleepy: The Truth About Hypnotherapy</p>

<p>For many years, people have been amused, confused and intrigued by hypnotherapy.</p>

<p>TV comedies have long played scenes of hypnosis for laughs: a mysterious person swings a pocket watch in front of a patient’s eyes, saying something like, “You are feeling sleepy.”</p>

<p>Then, when they’re asleep, the hypnotist is able to tell the person how to act when they wake up.</p>

<p>But some experts say hypnotism is more than just a TV trope, and hypnotherapy is a really useful treatment that deserves our respect.</p>

<p>Research suggests that hypnotherapy can help reduce feelings of pain, stress and anxiety, and even eases the side effects of cancer treatment. People also credit it with helping them lose weight or give up smoking.</p>

<p>So how does it actually work?</p>

<p>The first thing to say is that it doesn’t work for everyone, and swinging watches aren’t required! Basically, the therapist uses the power of suggestion to influence the patient.</p>

<p>People are encouraged to enter into a state of relaxation that allows them to concentrate better.</p>

<p>For those who are susceptible, the hypnotherapist will often speak slowly and softly to help the patient relax. They might ask them to imagine they are on a beach, or somewhere else they’ll feel calm.</p>

<p>Then, when they’re in a relaxed state, the therapist will make suggestions designed to improve the patient’s viewpoint, whether that’s related to their need to smoke or their feelings of pain.</p>

<p>The idea is that it’s easier for patients to accept guidance, criticism or suggestion when they’re in this relaxed state.</p>

<p>However, experts remind people that they are still in control of their actions.</p>

<p>But while hypnotherapy has gained credibility over time, some medical professionals say more research is still needed.</p>

<p>And some believe that patients and therapists should be cautious about using hypnotherapy to manage stressful events from childhood. When used in this way, experts say it could contribute to increased anxiety, or even lead to the formation of false memories.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="language" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[You Are Feeling Sleepy: The Truth About Hypnotherapy]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">我决定简单的生活</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/review/life/book/review129/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="我决定简单的生活" /><published>2025-02-20T13:01:30+08:00</published><updated>2025-02-20T13:01:30+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/review/life/book/review129</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/review/life/book/review129/"><![CDATA[<p>「酒精不能带来幸福，只能暂时停止不幸。」</p>

<p>只租不买</p>

<p>肚子饿时去超市买东西，结果买了超乎预期的食物回家；当你肚子饿时，到小酒馆点餐，结果点了一堆吃不完的菜而后悔。这些结果皆来自于你基于「现在」肚子饿的状态，预测该吃多少的「未来」状况所做的错误判断。人一直认为自己可以预测未来，可惜却连三十分钟后的事情都无法正确判断。</p>
