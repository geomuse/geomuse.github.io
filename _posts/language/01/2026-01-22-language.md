# Will Australia's Social Media Ban Actually Work?

Australia brought in a new law in late 2025 that bans children under 16 from using many social media apps.

The ban, which aims to protect young people from cyberbullying, online addiction and harmful content, has affected popular platforms such as TikTok and Instagram.

Soon after the ban began, the government said the law was already having an effect. It reported that more than 4.7 million accounts believed to belong to under-16s were removed in just the first few days. And Meta, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, said it blocked almost 550,000 accounts on its platforms.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it was "encouraging" that social media companies were making efforts to stop children from using their platforms.

However, many Australian teenagers say the ban has not stopped them from using social media. As 14-year-old Felix Webster told Sky News: "Everyone's going to find a way around it easily."

Teens say they can still access social media by changing their age, using a VPN, or logging in with a parent's account. Some have moved to smaller apps not clearly included in the ban.

Some young people say social media is important to them and helps them relax after school. Without it, they say they feel more bored and cut off from friends, especially during school holidays.

There are also mixed views among adults.

One parent told Sky News that the law has "a lot of good stuff," but added that it will not "suddenly save all the kids from harm."

The opposition has been more critical. Shadow minister Melissa McIntosh said the ban had "fallen flat" and that age checks are easy to get around.

It remains unclear if Australia's ban will truly reduce social media use or just encourage teens to find new ways to stay online.
