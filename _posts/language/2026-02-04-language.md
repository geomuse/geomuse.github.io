# How to Get the Best Workers for Your Company

Every company wants to be successful. And successful companies need great workers!

So, how can bosses find the best people for their company?

One important thing is to write a really good job description.

Alessia Musso from the HR company Homerun says this will help the company understand more about the person they need.

A good job description will also help attract the right person for the job. And it should also tell people why the company is a great place to work!

It can help to have an application form that asks good questions about people's skills and experience. This will also help bosses to choose the best person.

Michael Page, a US company that helps people find jobs, says bosses should also look for a worker with the right personality. A person with the right personality could be better than a person with a lot of experience.

Musso from Homerun also says that bosses should talk to other people in the company before they choose a new worker. Maybe those other people will help them see which person is best for the job.

And bosses should also take their time to find the right worker. That's because finding the right person takes time. It can be better to wait for the right person than to choose the wrong one!
