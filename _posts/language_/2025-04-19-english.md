You Are Feeling Sleepy: The Truth About Hypnotherapy

For many years, people have been amused, confused and intrigued by hypnotherapy.

TV comedies have long played scenes of hypnosis for laughs: a mysterious person swings a pocket watch in front of a patient's eyes, saying something like, "You are feeling sleepy."

Then, when they're asleep, the hypnotist is able to tell the person how to act when they wake up.

But some experts say hypnotism is more than just a TV trope, and hypnotherapy is a really useful treatment that deserves our respect.

Research suggests that hypnotherapy can help reduce feelings of pain, stress and anxiety, and even eases the side effects of cancer treatment. People also credit it with helping them lose weight or give up smoking.

So how does it actually work?

The first thing to say is that it doesn't work for everyone, and swinging watches aren't required! Basically, the therapist uses the power of suggestion to influence the patient.

People are encouraged to enter into a state of relaxation that allows them to concentrate better.

For those who are susceptible, the hypnotherapist will often speak slowly and softly to help the patient relax. They might ask them to imagine they are on a beach, or somewhere else they'll feel calm.

Then, when they're in a relaxed state, the therapist will make suggestions designed to improve the patient's viewpoint, whether that's related to their need to smoke or their feelings of pain.

The idea is that it's easier for patients to accept guidance, criticism or suggestion when they're in this relaxed state.

However, experts remind people that they are still in control of their actions.

But while hypnotherapy has gained credibility over time, some medical professionals say more research is still needed.

And some believe that patients and therapists should be cautious about using hypnotherapy to manage stressful events from childhood. When used in this way, experts say it could contribute to increased anxiety, or even lead to the formation of false memories.
