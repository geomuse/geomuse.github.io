Airport Theory: The Last-Minute Travel Trend

Arriving at the airport 15 minutes before your flight might sound crazy, but for some travelers, it's the new normal.

A new travel trend called "airport theory" is becoming popular online, especially on TikTok. The idea is simple, but risky: arrive at the airport just before your flight boards — sometimes only 15 minutes early — and try to make it through security in time.

People doing this will check in online and bring only carry-on bags. This means they don't have to go to the check-in desk, and can go straight to security instead.

This trend is growing on TikTok, where users post videos of themselves rushing through the airport. Some users have posted videos where they make it to their gate quickly, even in big, busy airports.

But many others aren't so lucky, and have shared videos where they've missed their flights.

So while it might work for a few lucky travelers, most experts don't recommend trying "airport theory."

Security checks take time, and before you even get to the airport, you might get stuck in traffic or have other delays. And after security, it can also take time to find your gate, especially in larger airports.

That's why most airports still recommend arriving two hours before domestic flights and three hours before international ones.

Airport theory might look exciting online, but it doesn't work for everyone. For most people, getting to the airport earlier is a safer and more comfortable way to travel.
