One of the World's Smallest Countries Gets First ATMs

April 15 was an exciting day for one of the world's smallest countries, as Tuvalu got its first ATMs.

Tuvalu is made up of a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, and only about 11,000 people live there. The total land area of the islands is just 26 square kilometers.

There are now five ATMs on the main island of Funafuti, where about half of the country's residents live.

A ceremony with Prime Minister Feleti Teo and other government staff was held at the National Bank of Tuvalu in the village of Vaiaku. Bank CEO Siose Penitala Teo was pictured trying out the ATM for the first time.

"These were dreams for us," Teo said, speaking with The Guardian.

It took nearly $2 million and about four years for those dreams to become a reality.

According to The Guardian, until now, people would have to go to the bank on pay day to receive their money. This could take hours, and was not made easier by the fact that the bank closes at 2 p.m.

There are now also 30 sales terminals on the island, meaning shops will be able to take electronic payments for the first time. Until now, almost everything on Tuvalu was paid for by cash.

However, only prepaid cards can be used on the machines for now. The bank plans to introduce debit cards in the future.
